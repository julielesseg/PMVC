			<p class="section-txt"> The Portland Metro Veterans Connection goal is to provide ongoing support
and continued partnership opportunities for Metro area veterans of all eras. It
is our mission to help veterans build and sustain lasting relationships by
creating a safe and social environment for connecting to one another and
sharing common experiences. We organize various events for local veterans
and their friends and families that can act as a great first step towards
reintegrating into the community and also are a great way to meet up with
other vets and be active together.</p>
